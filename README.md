# Hello
This is a website I made for Callan Wassenaar, an independent candiate for the federal election in the Battle River - Crowfoot area.

The request was for a simple website that would cover everything they need. The list of needs and colours were selected by Callan. I had to make the website accessibile for everyone on the web.
## Site Structure Requested
- **Homepage**
- **About**
- **Platform**
- **A Volunteer/Join Form**
- **Updates/Blog** We removed this from the table since I embedded his social media accounts
- **Contact**
- **Social Media Integration**
- **Events Calendar** This is already part of the site. Unfortunately, I was never provided with upcoming events, regardless of several requests.

### Design Preferences
- Colour palette: Royal Purple, Teal, Gold, and Black.

Project timeline was only 2 weeks before projected launch day. I completed this project 2 days before launch day.
